task_1 schema

Objective
In this task, you will:

Install and configure the required software on your local computer
Set up an AWS account with the necessary permissions and security configurations
Deploy S3 buckets for Terraform states
Create a Github Actions workflow to deploy infrastructure in AWS
Additional tasks:

Create a federation with your AWS account for Github Actions
Create an IAM role for Github Actions
Steps
Install AWS CLI and Terraform

Follow the instructions to install AWS CLI 2.
Follow the instructions to install Terraform 1.6+.
optional Configuring Terraform version manager tfenv
Create IAM User and Configure MFA

Configure AWS CLI

Configure AWS CLI to use the new user's credentials.
Verify the configuration by running the command: aws ec2 describe-instance-types --instance-types t4g.nano.
Create a Github repository for your Terraform code

Using your personal account create a repository rsschool-devops-course-tasks
